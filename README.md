# cx-vf-linux-tools

This repository contains loose tooling used for automated ConnectX NIC VF setup
for non-hypervisor use on modern Linux systems.

Note that at the time of creation, this repository does not contain any system
automation itself for baremetal bringup, only the content one might seed in a
baremetal hypervisor image. All such content is in the subdir 
[baremetal](./baremetal).
